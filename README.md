FTC Team <strong>33516</strong>'s code, available for public use since this is really not that good.

<hr>
Built based on <i>RoadRunner</i>, thus to use the code, <mark>Gradle needs reconfiguration</mark>.
<h1>Version 0.1.1.</h1>

<pre>
  +---Class ArtefactHandler:
          +-function takeArtefact:
          |    Power intake motors to take in artefact while spinning launching flywheel backwards.
          +-function keepArtefact:
          |    Stop all intake motors.
          +-function discardArtefact:
          |    Spin intake motors backwards.
          +-function spoolUp:
          |    Power up launcher motors until reaching set velocity.
          +-function launchArtefact:
          |    Power up intake motors while launcher motors run.
          +-function Halt:
               Stop all motors involved in launching artefacts.
</pre>
<br>
All features remain similar.
Launching now done in intervals.
Expanded to various situations.

Classes also called alongside RoadRunner commands.<br>
PIDF incorporated into motors to maintain target speeds.<br>
Launcher and servo functions fixed.
